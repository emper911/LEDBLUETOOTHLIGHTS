# LEDBLUETOOTHLIGHTS
This project contains code used to make a webpage interact with an LED light strips connected to an Arduino, communicating over a bluetooth connection using the serialport. Second half of this project required building a curcuit to control bluetooth lighting using the pwm pins on the arduino to control RGB LEDs, and used a relay to turn on/off main power source running at 12v DC supplying the LEDS.
